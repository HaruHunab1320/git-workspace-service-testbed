# Rainy Days

There is something quietly beautiful about rainy days. The soft patter of rain against the window invites a kind of stillness that the hurried world rarely offers. Streets glisten under gray skies, and the air carries the earthy scent of wet soil and fresh beginnings. On days like these, time seems to slow, leaving room for a warm cup of tea, a good book, or simply the gentle pleasure of watching droplets trace their winding paths down the glass.
