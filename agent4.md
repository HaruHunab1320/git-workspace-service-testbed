There is something deeply calming about letting a gentle stream of relaxing music wash over you after a long day. Soft piano melodies, ambient soundscapes, and lofi beats with their warm vinyl crackle have a way of quieting the mind and easing tension from the body. Whether you are studying, unwinding before sleep, or simply sitting with a cup of tea, the right music can transform an ordinary moment into a peaceful retreat.
