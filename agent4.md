# Relaxing Music

There is something deeply restorative about listening to relaxing music at the end of a long day. Gentle piano melodies, ambient soundscapes, and lofi beats create a calm atmosphere that helps quiet the mind and ease tension from the body. Whether you prefer the soft strum of an acoustic guitar or the warm hum of synthesizers layered over vinyl crackle, these sounds invite you to slow down, breathe deeply, and simply be present in the moment.
