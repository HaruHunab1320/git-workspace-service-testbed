Relaxing music has a remarkable ability to calm the mind and ease tension after a long day. Gentle melodies, soft piano, ambient soundscapes, and lofi beats create an atmosphere that encourages deep breathing and peaceful reflection. Whether you're unwinding before bed, studying, or simply taking a moment for yourself, the right music can transform your environment into a tranquil retreat.
