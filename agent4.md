Relaxing music has a remarkable ability to calm the mind and ease tension after a long day. Whether it's the gentle strum of an acoustic guitar, the soft patter of rain layered over ambient pads, or a lofi hip-hop beat with warm vinyl crackle, these sounds create a peaceful atmosphere that encourages deep breathing and mindfulness. Listening to such music can lower heart rate, reduce stress hormones, and help listeners drift into a state of tranquil focus.
