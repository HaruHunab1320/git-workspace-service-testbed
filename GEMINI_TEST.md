# Gemini CLI

The Gemini CLI is a command-line interface tool designed to interact with Google's Gemini large language models. It allows developers and users to:

-   **Chat with Gemini:** Send prompts and receive responses directly from the terminal.
-   **Process Files:** Analyze and manipulate text files, code, and data using Gemini's capabilities.
-   **Automate Tasks:** Script complex workflows by chaining Gemini prompts and shell commands.
-   **Manage Projects:** Use Gemini as an intelligent assistant for coding, debugging, and project management tasks.

It serves as a bridge between the powerful AI capabilities of Gemini and the local development environment.
