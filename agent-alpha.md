On a quiet Sunday afternoon, rain tapping gently against the windowpane, there is nothing quite like curling up under a soft knitted blanket with a warm cup of matcha in hand. The earthy sweetness fills the room as sunlight filters through the curtains, casting golden streaks across a stack of well-loved books. A cat stretches lazily on the armchair nearby, purring in perfect contentment, and the world outside feels wonderfully far away.
