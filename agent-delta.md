There is a quiet kind of joy in settling into a favorite chair beside the window, letting the afternoon light fall softly across the pages of a well-loved book. The world outside drifts by in gentle motion — leaves turning, clouds shifting — while inside, time slows to the rhythm of each sentence. Reading by the window feels like a small act of peace, a reminder that stillness and wonder can live side by side.
