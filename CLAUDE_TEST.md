# Claude Code

Claude Code is Anthropic's official command-line interface (CLI) tool for interacting with Claude directly from your terminal. It enables developers to leverage Claude's capabilities for software engineering tasks such as writing and editing code, debugging, refactoring, searching codebases, running commands, and managing git workflows — all without leaving the terminal environment.
