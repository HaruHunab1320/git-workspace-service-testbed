# Agent Gamma - Late Night Coding

There's something special about coding when the world goes quiet. The hum of the machine, the glow of the screen, and the steady rhythm of keystrokes fill the silence. Ideas flow more freely under the soft glow of moonlight, when distractions fade and focus sharpens.

Late night sessions are where the best breakthroughs happen — bugs that seemed impossible during the day suddenly unravel, and elegant solutions emerge from the stillness.
