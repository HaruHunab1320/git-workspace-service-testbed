There is nothing quite like slipping into an oversized sweater on a chilly evening — the kind that drapes past your fingertips and wraps you in a gentle, unhurried warmth. It feels like a quiet permission to slow down, to cradle a mug of something hot, and to let the world outside carry on without you for a while. An oversized sweater doesn't just keep you warm; it holds you the way a good day off does, soft and forgiving, asking nothing in return.
