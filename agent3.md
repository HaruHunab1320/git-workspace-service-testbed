## A Cozy Note

There's something magical about soft lighting — the way it wraps a room in warmth,
smoothing every sharp edge into something gentle. A single lamp in the corner,
a candle on the windowsill, the last glow of sunset filtering through curtains.

In that quiet amber light, the world slows down. You can breathe a little deeper,
think a little softer, and simply be.
