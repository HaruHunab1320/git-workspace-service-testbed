Rain has a way of transforming the world around us, turning dusty streets into shimmering mirrors and coaxing the earth into releasing its rich, loamy scent. There is something deeply calming about the steady rhythm of rain against a window, a natural lullaby that invites reflection and stillness. Whether it arrives as a gentle drizzle or a torrential downpour, rain reminds us that renewal is always just a storm away.
