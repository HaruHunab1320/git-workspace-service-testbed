# Rainy Days

There is something quietly wonderful about rainy days — the way the sky turns a soft grey and the world slows down just enough for you to notice it. The steady rhythm of rain on the roof invites reflection, and stepping outside means dodging every puddle on the sidewalk or, if you're feeling bold, splashing right through them. The air smells fresh, the streets glisten, and for a little while everything feels washed clean and full of possibility.
