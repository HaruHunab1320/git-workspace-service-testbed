Matcha is a finely ground powder made from specially grown green tea leaves that has been a cornerstone of Japanese tea ceremonies for centuries. The vibrant green color comes from the high chlorophyll content developed by shading the tea plants before harvest. Rich in antioxidants and L-theanine, matcha provides a calm, sustained energy without the jittery effects of coffee. Whether whisked into a traditional bowl or blended into a modern latte, matcha continues to captivate people around the world with its unique earthy flavor and numerous health benefits.
