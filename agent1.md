# Tea

There is something deeply calming about the ritual of brewing a cup of tea. Whether you prefer a bold black tea to start your morning, a delicate green tea in the afternoon, or a warm cup of matcha whisked to a frothy perfection, each variety offers its own distinct character and comfort. The act of boiling water, steeping leaves, and savoring that first sip invites a moment of stillness into an otherwise busy day.
